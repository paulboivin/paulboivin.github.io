# paulboivin.github.io â€” GitHub Pages user site

This repository is a GitHub Pages user site for paulboivin. It serves the files in the repository root.

How to update:
- Edit `index.html` or add other static files (CSS, JS, images) at the repository root.
- Commit and push to the `main` branch.

Optional workflow:
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` is an optional GitHub Actions workflow that copies the repo root into `public/` and deploys it to GitHub Pages automatically on push. You don't need this for a simple static site, but it's useful if you later add a build step.
